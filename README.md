1CRedit
=======

Launch date: April 21st, 2014 

History:  1CRedit was created to be the 4th coin in the game 1BillionHex.  
Although a game coin in the sense of that being the driver, it is a fully 
functional cyber coin that can stand alone.

The genesis of the coin is to be something as stable as the current 
Bitcoin/Litecoin codebase will allow.  A modified difficulty algorithm is used 
to attempt to minimize difficulty swings due to pool or raider mining.

Long block times and high confirmation requirements should minimize fork 
opportunities.  They will tend to make this an "investment" coin rather than a 
"transaction" code.

Key stats:

Project started in mid April, 2014, after the first KGW exploit and a multitude
of "pump and dump" short term coins have come and gone.

1 Coin payout.  1 Coin for block 1 and every block thereafter.  No half life.
 
Total coins:  (2^63-1)/100,000,000 (# of Satoshi in a coin):  92,233,720,368
              (92 Billion - max supported by current code)

512 second (~8.5 minute) block time - reducing stale mining block percentages 
to around 2%

156 new block confirms (~1 day confirms)
16 block transaction confirms (~2.3 hours)

Kimoto Gravity Well difficulty adjustment

~1.5M years worth of coins

Blocksize limited to 16KB for fast propagation.  Note this significantly 
restricts the number of transactions/second supported by 1CRedit, but as an 
investment coin, designed for fewer, larger, mostly paid transactions, this is 
not viewed as an issue.

Credits

Obviously, primary credit has to go to the Bitcoin and Litecoin development 
teams without whome this project would never have been conceived of.  The 
wallet code was cloned from the 0.8.6.2 release of Litecoin.  Addition credits

And all the folks responsible for QT, MingW32, and the other tools used to 
build the Windows version of this.

Development of 1CRedit was done using a Gentoo Linux environment.
